# Phase 1 - AI Upstander

## Research and Planning

### Introduction
This document outlines the findings from the research and planning phase of the project aimed at enhancing the **Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR) Upstander Program** through **AI-driven personalization**. The goal is to create a tailored, interactive experience that deepens users’ connection with human rights issues and empowers them to take action.

### Initial Findings from CMHR Consultation and Web Content
- The **Upstander Program** inspires individuals, particularly youth, to recognize injustices, identify their strengths, and take action.
- AI should enhance the program by providing **tailored content** and guiding users through the **three core components** of the program.
- Users find the stories of upstanders (e.g., **Malala Yousafzai, Viola Desmond**) inspiring but desire a **more interactive experience**.
- **Personalization** based on interests and strengths would increase engagement.
- **In-gallery experiences** could be enriched with **location-specific information** and **interactive elements**.

## AI Techniques for Personalization

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- Used to create a **conversational AI chatbot** that guides users through the Upstander Program.
- **Example:** The chatbot asks users about their interests, personal strengths, and provides **personalized recommendations**.

### **Tools and Libraries**
- **OpenAI’s ChatGPT API** – For building the conversational AI chatbot.
- **Pandas** – For processing and analyzing UAP data.
- **Flask** – For building the backend server.

## Data Review

### **Available Data Sources**
1. **Upstander Program Content** (Website)
   - Stories of notable upstanders (e.g., **Malala Yousafzai, Viola Desmond**).
   - Self-reflection activities and calls to action.
2. **Universal Access Points (UAPs)**
   - **250204_UAP Locations and Alignments.pdf** – Contains detailed information about UAP locations and alignments in the museum.

### **Key Findings**
- The **UAP data** will be utilized to provide **location-specific information** in the chatbot, enhancing the **in-gallery experience**.

## Scope
The goal is to develop a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** with the following core features:
- **AI-driven chatbot**.
- **Personalized recommendations**.
- **Integration with UAP locations**.

## Conclusion
The **research and planning phase** has provided a clear understanding of the project’s requirements and available resources. Although educational content from the museum’s education team is unavailable, the **Upstander Program content and UAP data** offer a strong foundation for the **AI-driven journey**. 

The next step is **Phase 2: Initial Development and Prototyping**, where the foundational features of the AI system will be built.
