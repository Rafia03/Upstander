# AI-Driven Personalized Journey for the Upstander Program

## Overview

This project aims to enhance the **Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR)** Upstander Program by integrating **AI-driven personalization** to create a tailored, interactive experience for users. The goal is to deepen users' connection with human rights issues, inspire them to recognize injustices, identify their strengths, and take action. The project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and other AI techniques to provide personalized recommendations and interactive experiences, both online and in-gallery.

## Project Goals

- **Enhance User Engagement**: Create a personalized journey through the Upstander Program using AI to tailor content based on user interests and strengths.
- **Interactive Experience**: Develop an AI-driven chatbot that guides users through the program, offering location-specific information and interactive elements.
- **Empower Users**: Encourage users to take action on human rights issues by providing them with relevant, personalized content and calls to action.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Chatbot**: A conversational AI chatbot that interacts with users, asks about their interests, and provides personalized recommendations.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored content based on user inputs, such as interests, strengths, and preferred learning styles.
- **In-Gallery Integration**: Use of **Universal Access Points (UAPs)** data to provide location-specific information and enhance the in-gallery experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For building the conversational AI chatbot.
- **OpenAI's ChatGPT API**: To power the chatbot interactions.
- **Pandas**: For processing and analyzing UAP data.
- **Flask**: For building the backend server.
- **Other Libraries**: Additional Python libraries for data processing, recommendation systems, and user interface development.

## Project Phases

1. **Research and Planning (Completed)**:
   - Analyzed the existing Upstander Program and identified key requirements.
   - Conducted stakeholder interviews to understand user needs.
   - Researched AI techniques suitable for personalization.
   - Developed detailed project specifications and a timeline.

2. **Initial Development and Prototyping**:
   - Implement foundational features, such as data processing and content integration.
   - Develop a basic chatbot for testing AI feasibility.
   - Create a prototype for user feedback.

3. **Refinement and Feature Expansion**:
   - Refine the prototype based on user feedback.
   - Add advanced features like personalized recommendations and multi-platform compatibility.
   - Implement interactions tailored for different contexts (in-gallery, online, classrooms).

4. **Testing and Finalization**:
   - Iterate on the design and implementation to address issues.
   - Test the final product for stability and usability.
   - Finalize features for the final presentation.

5. **Final Presentation and Delivery**:
   - Prepare a polished demo of the AI-driven Upstander Program journey.
   - Deliver the final product with documentation and user guides.

## Deliverables

- **AI-Driven Personalized Journey**: A functional AI system that tailors the userâ€™s journey through the Upstander Program.
- **User Interface (UI)**: An intuitive interface for users to engage with the program online, in-gallery, or in classrooms.
- **Final Presentation**: A comprehensive presentation showcasing the AI journey, key learnings, and outcomes.

## Stretch Goals

- **Multilingual Support**: Implement additional features to make the program accessible to a wider audience.
- **Integration with Other Educational Tools**: Develop a version of the AI journey that can integrate with other platforms used by the museum.

## Shrink Goals

- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: A working prototype of the personalized AI journey with a focus on one or two key interactions (e.g., a simple chatbot guiding users through a basic version of the program).
